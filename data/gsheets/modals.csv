Gooseneck barnacles have stalks and attach to rocky areas along highly exposed coastlines since they depend on water motion for feeding. Acorn barnacles typically dominate the high intertidal zone on the Olympic Coast. Barnacles are important members of the rocky intertidal ecosystem and can help create conditions that are favorable to some types of native algae. Barnacles are vulnerable to smothering from oil spills because floating oil is often deposited in the highest intertidal zones.,NA
