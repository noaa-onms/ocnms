NA,NA,NA,NA,F,Pinnipeds,https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/living/marinelife/mammals/mammals.html,https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/library/pixpages/librarypixpg_elephantseals.html,"Pinnipeds are marine mammals and carnivores that have adapted to life in the water and at the water's edge. They forage at sea in the open ocean, but come ashore at some time of the year to mate, give birth, suckle their young, molt, or rest on sandy beaches or rocky shore habitats. Pinnipeds are divided into two families: Eared seals or sea lions (otariids) and the earless or true seals (phocids). Steller and California sea lions are representative eared seals of the Olympic Coast. Harbor seals and elephant seals are the only earless seals of the Olympic Coast.",NA

NA,NA,NA,NA,F,Amphipods and isopods,https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/living/marinelife/inverts/inverts.html,NA,"Amphipods and isopods are two large groups of marine crustaceans that are commonly found on Olympic Coast beaches. Like other detritivores and scavengers, these beach hoppers help to clean up beaches by eating wrack and carcasses before becoming prey for shorebirds and surfzone fishes.",NA
NA,NA,NA,NA,F,Phytoplankton,https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/phyto.html,NA,"Phytoplankton are small, often microscopic, algae that largely just drift with the ocean current as they soak up the energy of the sun. Despite being small, they pack a big punch in marine ecosystems because a wide variety of marine life survives by eating phytoplankton. Phytoplankton blooms on the Olympic Coast occur seasonally when coastal upwelling draws deeper ocean waters onto the continental shelf and delivers nutrients to coastal waters. Phytoplankton blooms can sometimes be detected from space through remote sensing of chlorophyll at the sea surface. In addition to driving productivity within the ecosystem, decomposing phytoplankton also consume oxygen dissolved in seawater, contributing to drivers of seasonal hypoxia.",NA

From snails to crabs and clams to urchins, sandy seafloor habitats may harbor many unseen species of invertebrate life.",NA
NA,NA,NA,NA,F,Seafloor terrain complexity,https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/science/habitatmapping/habitatmapping.html,NA,"The substrate of the deep seafloor on the Olympic Coast is composed of large expanses of mud, sand and silt with scattered rocky habitats on the continental shelf and adjacent deep submarine canyons containing a diversity of substrates including additional hard bottom habitats. Seafloor mapping efforts continue to increase our understanding of terrain complexity, which can influence the distribution of species with specific habitat requirements, like species of deep sea coral and sponges that require hard substrate. Mixed substrates include seafloor areas that exhibit elements of both soft and hard substrates, with grain sizes ranging from sand to cobbles, pebbles and boulders.",No data in report

Most of the Washington population is fished from coastal areas near the Columbia River.,No data in report
kelp-forest,kelp-forest_rock-cover.html,rock-cover,F,F,Rock cover,NA,NA,Kelp forests support a great diversity of species; they provide important shelter and valuable habitat for many species. The two dominant canopy-forming kelp species along the Olympic coast are giant kelp and bull kelp. These and other species of kelp require hard rocky substrate to provide an attachment point for their ‘holdfast’--the structures that anchor the plants to the seafloor and stabilize the kelp forest community.,NA

Increasingly, offshore alternative energy installations are being considered in an effort to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate against climate change.",NEW
