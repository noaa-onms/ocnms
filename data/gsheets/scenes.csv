Deep Seafloor,deep-seafloor,"The deep seafloor in Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary is comprised mainly of soft sediments that are home to many species of bottom fish and invertebrates, like crabs and shrimp. Rocky habitat occurs as patches – scattered outcrops or steep canyon walls – habitat that support communities of deep sea corals and sponges. Colorful coral ""gardens"" provide habitat for important fish, including rockfish.",https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/living/habitats/seafloor/seafloor.html,https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/pgallery/pgolympic/habitats/habitats_4.html,NA
Kelp Forest,kelp-forest,"Gently swaying blades of bull kelp and giant kelp form dense stands resembling old growth forests on land, in which many species of fish and invertebrates thrive. Sea otters are most often seen rafting and resting in and near kelp forests. Rocky reefs, underwater extensions of rock formations on land, create rugged underwater landscapes that can be covered with attached organisms that are used as shelter by nearshore fishes.",https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/living/habitats/kelpforest/kelpforest.html,https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/pgallery/pgolympic/habitats/habitats_1.html,video: Sea otters on Olympic Coast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqp25p6nFtQ
Pelagic,pelagic,"The open ocean, from the sea surface to the deep sea, is a vast reservoir of life. Always in motion from wind and currents, the water teems with living organisms, from tiny drifting plankton and schools of fish to flocks of pelagic seabirds, and migrating whales.",https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/living/habitats/openocean/openocean.html,https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/pgallery/pgolympic/habitats/habitats_15.html,NA
Rocky Shore,rocky-shore,"The rocky shore is a habitat that alternates between the dry and wet worlds. Tide pools occur where boulders and rocky outcrops trap seawater when the tide recedes. At high tide, they form surge channels, crevices and cracks that are home to many familiar seashore animals, like seastars, hermit crabs and sea anemones",https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/living/habitats/intertidal/intertidal.html,https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/pgallery/pgolympic/habitats/habitats_8.html,NA
Sandy Beach,sandy-beach,"Serving as a buffer between the sea and the land, sandy beaches are home to crashing waves and resilient animals. Who can you find living in the sand?",https://sanctuarysimon.org/regional-nms/beaches/,https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/pgallery/pgolympic/habitats/habitats_10.html,NA
Sandy Seafloor,sandy-seafloor,Not all of the animals found in the ocean are found on reefs. The sandy seafloor is home to a dizzying array of clever and cryptic animals,https://sanctuarysimon.org/regional-nms/continental-shelf/,NA,NA
