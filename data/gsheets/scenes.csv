Overview,index,"Explore the interactive ecosystem for Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary! Navigate by clicking on icons representing our six major habitats, many species of interest, major climate and ocean drivers affecting the Olympic Coast, and the human connections that commonly occur here. The interactive icons and silhouettes you’ll see on the following pages will allow you to access information about the Olympic Coast, including graphs and figures containing status and trend data, maps, images, web stories and other supporting content.",https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CMpKnWjNDVZF5JIM5wUo21Ubwwts2ejg/view?usp=sharing,Is the link to Simon important for OCNMS?
Deep Seafloor,deep-seafloor,"Deep seafloor habitats are usually cold, dark and subject to intense pressure, making it a challenging habitat to access and study. Organisms living here are specially adapted to their environments; many grow slowly and are vulnerable to physical disturbance and changing ocean conditions. Shrimp, rockfish, halibut, and whiting, are often found living in, on or just above the seafloor, attracting commercial, recreational, and subsistence harvesters. Most of the deep seafloor in Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary is composed of soft sediments. Rocky habitat often occurs in patches – like on scattered boulders and rocky outcrops or along steep canyon walls. Although relatively scarce, hard bottom seafloor habitats often support long-lived communities of deep sea corals and sponges which in turn provide habitat for rockfish and other seafloor dwellers. Thousands of methane seeps, and the unique communities associated with them, have been identified in OCNMS in recent years.",https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/living/habitats/seafloor/seafloor.html,https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/education/teachers/deep-coral-communities/deep-sea-coral.html,NA
Kelp Forest,kelp-forest,"Kelp forests at Olympic Coast are composed of two canopy-forming species: bull kelp and giant kelp, which together support many other species that find shelter and sustenance within this highly productive ecosystem. Understory kelp and algae interact continuously with fish, benthic invertebrates, and sea otters in a delicate balance that helps to maintain ecosystem stability and function.",https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/living/habitats/kelpforest/kelpforest.html,https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/pgallery/pgolympic/habitats/habitats_1.html,video: Sea otters on Olympic Coast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqp25p6nFtQ
Pelagic,pelagic,"Open ocean or ‘pelagic’ habitat covers most of the planet and is the largest habitat type on earth. Extending from the sea surface to near the seafloor, pelagic habitat supports a vast diversity of species--from tiny plankton to blue whales--that depend on the ocean for food, movement, communication, and other essential functions. Many species that are important to open ocean ecosystems, such as humpback whales and albatross, are seasonal visitors to the Olympic Coast, traveling great distances each year to feast on the productivity of this special place during the upwelling season.",https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/living/habitats/openocean/openocean.html,https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/pgallery/pgolympic/habitats/habitats_15.html,NA
Rocky Shore,rocky-shore,"Rocky shores are abundant along sections of the Olympic Coast and surround many offshore islands, providing habitat for creatures that can tolerate this dynamic and exposed environment. Visitors are likely to find sea stars, anemones, mussels and barnacles in addition to numerous seabirds and pinnipeds that feed, nest or rest along the coastline.",https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/living/habitats/intertidal/intertidal.html,https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/pgallery/pgolympic/habitats/habitats_8.html,NA
Beaches,sandy-beach,"Beaches along the Olympic Coast exhibit a diversity of grain sizes ranging from fine sand to gravel and cobbles, often with large boulders and picturesque offshore rocks and islands scattered along the shoreline. Beach profiles change seasonally along this dynamic shoreline, showing marked differences in slope between summer and winter. Winter storms shape the coast, prompting erosion and even landslides that may impact coastal habitats, species, maritime heritage resources, and communities. In addition to providing habitat for marine species that may burrow in or scurry across the sediment, beaches provide important foraging areas for terrestrial species like black bears, river otters, and eagles.",https://sanctuarysimon.org/regional-nms/beaches/,https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/pgallery/pgolympic/habitats/habitats_10.html,NA
Sandy Seafloor,sandy-seafloor,"Sandy seafloor habitats extend seaward from the shore, encompassing areas of the continental shelf in waters less than 30m (~100 ft) deep. These areas of the seafloor, which are dominated by sand, mud and silt, tend to shift over time, favoring organisms that burrow and scurry or can tolerate changes in the substrate. Surf perch, forage fish, and Dungeness crab frequently utilize sandy seafloor areas. Washington’s sea otters are known to forage within this habitat, in addition to the kelp forests with which they are often associated.",https://sanctuarysimon.org/regional-nms/continental-shelf/,NA,NA
Ocean & Climate,ocean-climate,"Ocean conditions are expected to undergo significant changes by the end of the century due to increasing carbon emissions, more than a quarter of which have been absorbed by the oceans. Many of the projected changes have the potential to profoundly impact coastal and marine ecosystems on both local and global scales, threatening the physical, social, cultural, economic, and environmental well-being of communities that depend on them. On the Olympic Coast, ocean conditions continue to change and intensify in response to climate change, prompting concerns about impacts from ocean acidification, warming ocean temperatures, increased stratification, rising sea levels, and declines in dissolved oxygen, as well as impacts from more intense and frequent marine heatwaves, harmful algal blooms, and coastal storms.",https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/living/oceanenvironments/oceanenviro.html,NA,NA
Human Connections,human-connections,"Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary is one of the nation’s most treasured areas, thanks to its rich abundance of marine mammals, seabirds, fish, and thriving invertebrate communities. The Olympic Coast is one of North America’s most productive marine regions, supporting some of the highest biodiversity on the west coast and sustaining Native American tribes for thousands of years. Since time immemorial, the vibrant contemporary cultures of the Quinault Indian Nation, and the Hoh, Makah, and Quileute tribes have lived on and cared for the lands and waters of the Olympic Coast, reflecting their deep and abiding connection to this special place. More recent residents and visitors are drawn to the Olympic Coast as well. Whether it's a first encounter with a tide pool or the experience of many generations, the Olympic Coast has shaped communities' identities, cultures, and livelihoods over time. Today, fishing, transportation, and recreation are central to the Olympic Coast's economic health and community well-being. Discover what it means to have an Olympic Coast way of life.",https://olympiccoast.noaa.gov/living/historyandculture/historyandculture.html,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UjsElIv3a36NpkQdWcmFThV6M_GDwuOL/view?usp=sharing,NA
