- [info_tagline](Once ruthlessly hunted for their prized fur coat, sea otters were reintroduced into the ocean waters along the Olympic peninsula due to their importance! Sea otters are a “keystone species,” meaning that they are an indicator of the health of a habitat. If their population is healthy, it means that other parts of the ecosystem, such as kelp forests and sandy bottoms, are likely also healthy.)
